 Agri-Input Supply Chain Pricing Analysis using Web Scraping & EDA
 Project Overview

This project analyzes pricing patterns of agricultural input products collected from an e-commerce platform using web scraping and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

The study standardizes package sizes, compares prices across brands, and evaluates cost efficiency to generate insights useful for farmers, retailers, and agri-business stakeholders.

 Business Problem

Farmers and buyers often face difficulty in choosing agri-input products due to:

Wide price variation across brands

 Hypothesis Testing
Hypothesis 1

Small and large packages have different price per unit.
✔ Result: Small packs are more expensive per unit.

Hypothesis 2

Price per unit differs across brands.
✔ Result: Brand pricing strategies vary significantly.

 Key Insights

Larger packs cost more overall but offer better unit price.

Some brands charge premium prices for similar products.

Price distribution is right-skewed.

Market is dominated by a few major brands.

Price per unit is more important than total price.

 Business Recommendations

Farmers should compare price per unit instead of total price.

Larger packs usually provide better cost efficiency.

Buyers should not rely only on brand popularity.

Retailers can adjust pricing strategies based on package size demand.
Outcome

The project produces a clean dataset and insights that help improve purchasing decisions and pricing transparency in the agri-input market.
